# Using OpenCV framework in Dataiku

This project is focused in provide a guide to integrate the OpenCV framework with the Dataiku platform. 

## Why is important?

We believe that this project will help some users (developers, data scientist or data engineers) the currently works with OpenCV framework to understand how to migrate your OpenCV project to Dataiku seamlessly.

## What are the different between Dataiku and other tools?

Dataiku provide a framework (based on APIs) to access data through objects like Datasets or Managed Folders. So, it is possible that your current developmens does not works well.

### Dataiku Dataset overview

A dataset is a data structure with direct connection to a data source (Database, object storage, etc). For example, we can create a dataset based on a connection to a AWS S3 Bucket in order to access to a CSV file.
